# Advanced Time Series Dashboard

This repository contains the source code for developing six different time series models, along with the frontend code.

## About the Data

The data was taken from Kaggle. The data is for hourly energy consumption for Commonwealth Edison, commonly known by the syllabic abbreviation as ComEd, the largest electric utility in Illinois, and the primary electric provider in Chicago and much of Northern Illinois.

## Notebooks Description

### 1. ARIMA.ipynb
This notebook contains the implementation of the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model for time series forecasting.

### 2. ETS.ipynb
This notebook demonstrates the use of the ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonal) model for time series forecasting.

### 3. Hybrid.ipynb
This notebook combines ANN (Artificial Neural Network) and ARIMA models to create a hybrid forecasting model.

### 4. LSTM.ipynb
This notebook includes the implementation of the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network model for time series forecasting.

### 5. PreProcessing_FeatureEngineering.ipynb
This notebook covers the preprocessing and feature engineering steps necessary for preparing the data for modeling.

### 6. SARIMA.ipynb
This notebook implements the SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. Note that this notebook is currently incomplete.

### 7. SVR.ipynb
This notebook contains the implementation of the SVR (Support Vector Regression) model for time series forecasting.

### 8. prophet.ipynb
This notebook demonstrates the use of Facebook's Prophet model for time series forecasting.
